#Morse code has been used as a communication aide in aviation, radio, assistive technology, and more.

#Here are a few rules to know when deciphering a Morse code message:

#Each character is separated by a single space.
#Each word is separated by three spaces.
#Capitalization does not matter.
#In this project, we are going to write a Swift program that uses dictionaries to encrypt and decrypt secret Morse code messages.
